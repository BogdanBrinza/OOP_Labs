Hello, dear Catalin.

README
 In this laboratory, I created a basic library management system using C++. 

 I implemented a Book class to represent individual books with attributes like title, author, and ISBN. The Library class manages a collection of books, providing methods to add, remove, and display books. 
  
 Key functionalities include adding a book to the list, removing a book by ISBN, and displaying all books in the library. 
   This exercise helped me understand object-oriented programming concepts and how to manage collections using the STL list container.
